The Fisher's Iris dataset is a well-known and frequently used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It was collected by the renowned statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in the 1930s. The dataset consists of measurements of four features of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. For each of the 150 iris flowers, the measurements were recorded, along with the species to which the flower belongs. The dataset contains 50 samples from each of three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

The Fisher's Iris dataset is often used for classification and clustering tasks in machine learning. It is a classic example of a well-defined and well-studied problem in the field, and it has been used extensively in research. Many machine learning algorithms have been tested and evaluated using the dataset.

The dataset is widely available and can be downloaded from various sources. It has been used as a benchmark for testing new machine learning algorithms, and it is also frequently used in introductory courses on machine learning and statistics. Its popularity can be attributed to its simplicity and the fact that it represents a real-world problem that can be easily understood and interpreted.

In summary, the Fisher's Iris dataset is a widely used and well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. Its popularity is due to its simplicity, real-world relevance, and the fact that it has been extensively studied and used as a benchmark for testing new algorithms.
In this project what have done here is firstly importing the modules which consist of the cell type,output I made use of pandas.after which I imported the iris dataset so made sure to copy both the notebook and the data into my working data folder.i summarize each variable the writeten function will create the text file named iris summary stat.txt where the summary of each variable will be saved.in plotting the histogram for each variable I use savefig function create a png file for each variable.
